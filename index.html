              Birhane Gulilat
            </h3>
            <p> &emsp; I was Born in Ethioia, Addis Ababa. I studied ElectroMechanical
              Engieeniring from Addis Abab Science and technology university and Graduated with a Bsc Degree. Studying
              ElectroMechanical Engieeniring led me to understand how to different ascpects of engineering such as
              Thermodynamics, Applied Electronics and programing lanuage such as C. After graduation i working in
              Different
              ElectroMechanical Projects, these porjects helped me hone my problem solving, planning and Stakeholder
              managment skills.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;After Working in installation for 3 years i decided to start learning once
              more when an opptournity presented itself. The opportunity was a for a free one year program in Software
              Engineering from the an institute called ALX. I have always had an affinity for computers, I had found
              courses
              that foucs on computer lanuages such as embedded systems and learning basics of C to be my favorite
              subjects
              so i decided to give it a try while still working my job which at this time has become slow and work was
              came
              further and further apart. At first i found the teaching methedology overwhelming, the way it goes is you
              are
              given a deadline and a set of tasks with an automated checker and set of resources from diffrent sources
              such
              as youtube videos, wikipidiea pages and a variety of sources from across the internet. What i found
              overwhelming about the process was that throught out my school and unviersity life i learned more from
              listining to a teacher or a lecturer and studying than just reading But though time i overcame these
              difficulties and started to enjoy the course material
            </p>
            <p>&MediumSpace; The Program started with teaching us the basics of using the linux termial and then it went
              into teaching us the C programming lanuage from basics such
              as what a datatype is and what functions are to more Advanced topics as pointers and their use in Linked
              lists
              and other data structures and finally giving us projects to implement our own printf function and a Basic
              Shell. Then the course material changed from C to Python again starting from basics and gradully
              increasing
              the complexity of its concepts such as wht class and objects are and how everything in python is an object
              to
              Advanced ideas using frameworks and Obecjt realation mappers in webdevelopmet. Finally we were giving a
              specialization choice in frontend or backend i chose backend and as such i took courses relted to node and
              using Express for backend and more topics on both sql and Nosql databases and the years learning process
              ended
              with us being tasked with creating a webapp of our choice with teams of four to showcase our abilities
